                    <!-- <p>I've made my home base in Sagada, Philippines, with my small family. My journey into tech started with a degree in mass communication. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
                    <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front end development and design, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code and design.</p> -->
                    <p>I am Jesi. I’m a front end developer and web designer, and Code for Brunch is my studio. I can’t wait to...<br>
                    … translate your ideas and goals into an out-of-the-box web design, or a complete website.<br>
                    … seamlessly take over the coding work so that you could fully focus on what you love doing best, designing.<br>
                    … be a part of your awesome team and build brands or tackle design projects together!<br>
                    … help your brand with a re-design or feature upgrade so that you could increase your customer base.</p>
                    <p>Some days I wrangle JavaScript, some days I’m prototyping with Adobe XD, and on yet other days I’m working on offline pet projects - such as a van conversion (yep, self-isolating somewhere with more nature than people sounds like a great idea). One thing is constant: I would look up from my work, and it’s always time for brunch!<br>
                    Last April 2020, I got into coding and design as my way of giving the global pandemic my middle finger. The world was a dumpster fire and enrolling into one of <span><a href="https://skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush’s</a></span> blueprints was the best decision I made for my family. Had COVID-19 not happened, would I still have gotten into coding or design? Yes. If not for anything else, tech has been helping me parent better! Furthermore, my roles have constantly engaged me in projects that really matter, and in advocacies I sincerely care about.</p>
